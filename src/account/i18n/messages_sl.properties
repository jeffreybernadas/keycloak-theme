# WARNING: Before modifying this file, run the following command:

# $ npx keycloakify own --path "account/i18n/messages_sl.properties"

# This file is provided by @keycloakify/keycloak-account-ui version 260305.0.1.
# It was copied into your repository by the postinstall script: `keycloakify sync-extensions`.

# IMPORTANT: This file contains the base translation. Modifying it directly is not recommended.
# To override or add custom messages, create a file named messages_sl_override.properties in the same directory.
# This file will be automatically loaded and merged with the base translation.
# If you're implementing theme variants, you can also create variant-specific `.properties` files.
# For example let's say you have defined `themeName: ["vanilla", "chocolate"]` then you can create the following files:
# messages_sl_override_vanilla.properties
# messages_sl_override_chocolate.properties
